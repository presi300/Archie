## Other stuff

**-Who is Archie ment for?**

>Archie is made with complete linux beginners in mind. It's for people who want to try arch linux but have only used ubuntu or haven't tried linux at all.
>It's also made for people that in general just wanna try arch linux but aren't fully confident that they can install it.

**-Why archie instead of archinstall?**

>*Archie* is a lot simpler than *archinstall* and sets up a lot more things for the end user. That might be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it and how much you know about arch linux.

**-Any guarantee that Archie will work with anything?**

>No. Archie has been tested only with virtual machines (VMware, VirtualBox), as I simply do not have the time/hardware to test it on bare metal. But there is no reason why it shouldn't work.

**-Is it better than archinstall?**

>Yes and No... Yes, in a way that it's a lot simpler for 1st timers to use/setup. No, in a way that it's not nearly as well written or customizable as *archinstall*.

**-How can i help developement if I want to?**

>I am not that good at bash scripting and this is my 1st project. Generally any feedback or suggestions on how to make it better will go a long way.

**-What about Nvidia drivers?**

>If you have used Archie, you would know that it doesn't have an option to setup Nvidia drivers, which is one of the main things new users struggle with.\n
>Simple: I have absolutely no way to test if the Nvidia drivers will work when setup with the script. Also i am not sure on what is the best way to setup Nvidia drivers, so that they don't break. Again... feedback and suggestions will go a long way here.
