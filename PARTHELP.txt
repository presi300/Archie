 Hello! This is the Archie partitioning guide.
 Please make sure to read this document carefully
 if you don't know how to setup linux partitions.

 Or google how to setup arch linux partitions.

 1. Upon exitting this file you will be prompted with
 a screen asking you to setup a partition table.

 There will be a couple of options but the only ones
 you should care about are [dos] and [gpt].

 Select [dos] if your computer is older and has a BIOS.
 Select [gpt] if your computer is newer and has a UEFI.
 If unsure select [dos].



 2. For [dos] you will need to create one partition
 (and a 2nd one by choice).

 Go to [ New ]  and hit enter to create a partition with the
 appropriate for you size.
 [EXAMPLE: Typing in 40G will create a partition with a size
 of 40GiB (~42GB) and select [ primary ].

 If you don't want to setup a swap partition,
 you can exit the partitioning tool
 by going to [ Write ], pressing enter, typing yes and
 then going to [ Quit ] and pressing enter again.

 If you want to setup swap, 1st thing you need to do
 is again going to [ New ] and creating a partition
 with the amount of swap you want.
 [RECCOMMENDED: 4G]
 Then go to [ Type ] and make that new partition you created the
 [82  Linux swap / Solaris] type.
 After you do that follow the instructions of the previous step.

 After all is done exit the partitioning tool
 by going to [ Write ], pressing enter, typing yes and
 then going to [ Quit ] and pressing enter again.

 3. For [gpt] you will need to create 2 partitions
 (and a 3rd one by choice)

 Go to [ New ]  and hit enter to create a partition
 that is about 300M.
 [HELP: Typing in 300M will create a partition with a size
 of 300M  and select [ primary ].

 Once you do that, go to [ Type ] and make that partition
 the EFI type (it's located further down).

 After you do that, follow the instructions
 from 2.
